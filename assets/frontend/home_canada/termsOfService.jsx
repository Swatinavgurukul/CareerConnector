                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">1. Job Listings</h6>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may make available Job Listings featuring employment opportunities through it’s search results or otherwise through the Site. Searching for Job listings on Simplifyhire is free for Job Seekers. Job Listings are created and provided by third parties over whom Simplifyhire exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that Simplifyhire has no control over the content of Job Listings, links to or from Job Listings, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site. For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Simplifyhire endeavours not to make such Job Listings available on the Site. If you leave the Simplifyhire Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party. Simplifyhire has no obligation to screen any Job Listings, or to include any Job Listings, in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Listings from the Site or your search result for any or no reason. You understand and agree that Simplifyhire has no obligation to present you with any or all Job Listings. We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Listing or other information submitted by any Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user. Simplifyhire assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Listings, Company Pages, screener questions and responses. Additionally, Simplifyhire may provide search options to narrow down Job Listings search results by job type categories (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by Simplifyhire, and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the Job Listings. Simplifyhire may reformat Job Listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile phone. Placement of a Job Listings on a certain page is not a representation regarding the nature of the role for legal purposes. Simplifyhire displays Job Listings based on a combination of relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted on Simplifyhire. You are not permitted to use Simplifyhire’s Site or its content other than for non-commercial purposes. For purposes of this Section A of the Simplifyhire General Terms of Service, all references to “you” or “your” shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as a Job Seeker. </p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">2. Resumes, Profile, and Recommended Jobs</h6>
                                    <p>By creating a public resume through the Site (“Simplifyhire Resume”) or uploading a file resume on the Site (collectively, “Your Resume” or “Job Seeker Resume”), you are requesting and authorizing Simplifyhire to make available Your Resume to third parties, such as Employers, that Simplifyhire believes may have an interest in Your Resume. If you do not want Simplifyhire to make available Your Resume to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Simplifyhire Resume and uploaded file resume to private. Setting Your Resume to private will not affect your previous applications or prevent employers you responded to from contacting you.</p>
                                    <p>By creating a Simplifyhire Resume or uploading a file resume on Simplifyhire, Simplifyhire may share with you Job Listings that match the contents of Your Resume. Simplifyhire may also highlight to you items in Your Resume that may match qualifications from the Job Listing, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Listing and may be missing from Your Resume. These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it. Applying for such Job Listings does not guarantee job interviews or hiring. Even where Simplifyhire highlights items or a Job Listing is shared with you, Simplifyhire assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Listings or highlights. By creating or uploading Your Resume, you are requesting and authorizing Simplifyhire, or an Simplifyhire vendor, to review or scan Your Resume and provide you feedback (in Simplifyhire’s discretion), including suggested changes. Simplifyhire assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any changes you make based on any provided feedback. Simplifyhire assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for the resume or application information you post, send or receive through the Site. By uploading a file resume on the Site, you agree that Simplifyhire may convert your file resume to a different file type. It is your responsibility to review Your Resume to ensure that the content appears as you intend, and that it contains the right information or any information you intend to include or update. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Simplifyhire to do so. It may take a few days for updates to your account or resume to be reflected. To mitigate fraud, Simplifyhire may mask or hide your contact information, for example, we may mask or hide your email address and/or phone number, from Your Resume or application and may substitute it with an alias. Simplifyhire makes no promise to you about whether all or part of your contact info will be masked or hidden, and the decision to mask or hide such info is in Simplifyhire’s sole discretion. Simplifyhire reserves the right to limit your ability to set Your Resume to public, and may toggle a public resume to private, at any time, to prevent illegal conduct, for fraud mitigation, or for any other reason in Simplifyhire’s discretion.</p>
                                    <p>If you have a Simplifyhire account, a Simplifyhire Resume, or an uploaded file resume, you agree that Simplifyhire may associate Your Resume data with your profile on Simplifyhire (“Simplifyhire Profile”). Your Simplifyhire Profile consists of information you provide on the Site in the “Profile” section of your account. This includes your Simplifyhire Resume, and any information in the “Settings” section, such as your desired job title, job types, work schedule, whether you are ready to work, or pay. Information in your Simplifyhire Profile, except as otherwise indicated on the Site, may be available to third parties, such as Employers. If you do not want Simplifyhire to make your Simplifyhire Profile available to third parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, set your Simplifyhire Resume and uploaded file resume to private or remove Your Resume. You can set your work availability on your profile to let Employers know that you can start work immediately.</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may also automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to create an Simplifyhire account or apply to a job. Simplifyhire may determine what these recommended jobs are on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to, any information you input on the Site about yourself (including in Your Resume), searches you run on the Site, jobs you click on, jobs you apply to, or the materials you provide in a job application to an Employer through Simplifyhire.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">3. Applying to Jobs Through Simplifyhire</h6>
                                    <p>Any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application or responses to screener questions, is subject to this Agreement and to Simplifyhire’s Privacy Policy. Once you provide information to an Employer (whether in the form of a job application, resume, email, or otherwise), Simplifyhire does not have control over the Employer’s use or disclosure of that information. If you want to request the Employer delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must make such a request directly to the Employer. Simplifyhire may use your application materials to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing, and Simplifyhire may reach out to you about such Job Listing. Simplifyhire may store such information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer available on the Site. To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Simplifyhire in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Simplifyhire services. In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Simplifyhire Apply or by  submitting your resume and application information to Simplifyhire, and you are requesting and authorizing Simplifyhire to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s). When you ask Simplifyhire to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Simplifyhire Apply or Simplifyhire’s relay system, or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Simplifyhire reserves the right to reformat such application or message.</p>
                                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that Employers may request that Simplifyhire assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Simplifyhire into one document, and you agree that in doing so, Simplifyhire assembles these application materials on your behalf. When you apply for a job on Simplifyhire you agree to Simplifyhire’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such processing is an essential part of this Agreement. Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Simplifyhire being processed and analyzed by Simplifyhire according to this Agreement and Simplifyhire’s Privacy Policy.</p>
                                    <p>When you apply to a job using Simplifyhire Apply, Simplifyhire will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent. We cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon. Simplifyhire also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. However, Simplifyhire may alert you when any of the above events occur. Please note that Job Listings may expire between the time you submit your application and from the time it is received. Simplifyhire has no responsibility for expired Job Listings or for delivering applications prior to a Job Listing’s expiration. In addition we cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by Employers. We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third party sites, including but not limited to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs). If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored on Simplifyhire, do not use the Simplifyhire Apply or Simplifyhire relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public mail system. You may contact the Employer directly to find alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through Simplifyhire. By using the Simplifyhire Apply system, you fully consent to the above.</p>
                                    <p>If you require alternative methods of screening or application, you must approach the Employer directly to request such as Simplifyhire is not responsible for the Employer application process.</p>
                                    <p>By using Simplifyhire, you agree that Simplifyhire is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s job application, messages, screener questions or their format or method of delivery, and that Simplifyhire does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer. Please note that Simplifyhire does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers. Some questions may be labeled as Optional, indicating only that the application may be submitted to the Employer without providing an answer. Simplifyhire cannot guarantee that the Employer will consider such an application or make a particular determination with regard to such an application. Simplifyhire may inform Job Seekers that an Employer’s requirement from a job description does not appear to be present on a resume or application; this information is presented without warranty and Simplifyhire does not guarantee that updating a resume or application will result in any job offer. Simplifyhire does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs. Simplifyhire cannot make any guarantee regarding health and safety measures in an Employer’s hiring or interviewing process. Simplifyhire recommends Job Seekers follow personal health and safety best practices as recommended by the World Health Organization or similar institution. <strong>Simplifyhire does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations. Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.</strong></p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may send you a notice relating to account security, such as informing you that you may have recently interacted with a compromised account. Simplifyhire cannot and does not guarantee that such notices will always be sent or received, and you therefore agree that Simplifyhire bears no responsibility for doing so. Simplifyhire makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may use your application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of your activity on Simplifyhire to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa. You agree and consent that Simplifyhire may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to Employers as matches or not matches. Simplifyhire may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Simplifyhire product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers). Simplifyhire may also highlight to you items in your prior application materials (including items in your resume and past responses to screener questions) that may match qualifications from the Job Listing, or highlight to you items that appear in the Job Listing that may not match your application materials. These highlights do not mean you are or are not qualified for the job or that you should or should not apply for it. Applying for such Job Listings does not guarantee job interviews or hiring. Even where Simplifyhire highlights items or a Job Listing is shared with you, Simplifyhire assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of Job Listings or highlights.</p>
                                    <p>By using Simplifyhire Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Simplifyhire to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought by the Employer, and you acknowledge that Simplifyhire has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections. Such notices can also be sent  automatically by Simplifyhire after a period of time as selected by the Employer, unless the Employer indicates to Simplifyhire their interest in your application. You acknowledge and agree that Simplifyhire has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer’s decision to not take an action on your application on Simplifyhire within the time period selected by the Employer. Any interactions the Employer has directly with you and not through a tool provided by Simplifyhire (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of through an Simplifyhire messaging Service) are not visible to Simplifyhire, and would not by themselves prevent a rejection notice from being sent.</p>
                                    <p>When you search for jobs on the Simplifyhire Job Search app and proceed to apply for a job, including jobs on third party sites, Simplifyhire may suggest information from your Simplifyhire profile to include in your application. It is your responsibility to review suggestions before accepting them and including them on your application.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">4. Communications and Other Actions on the Site</h6>
                                    <p>When you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, messages, applications, questions and responses in applications, and any other information) through or using the Site, Simplifyhire may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Simplifyhire product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise. When an Employer views, sends, stores or receives materials through or using the Site, Simplifyhire may inform you about such actions. Additionally, we may also inform you that an Employer has taken other actions with regards to a Job Listing, your Resume, or your application, such as pausing or closing a Job Listing, opening your Resume or application, viewing your Resume or application, responding to your Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to your application or Job Listing. Simplifyhire may inform the Employer about activities you take on the Site or your use of the Site, for example, whether you are online on Simplifyhire, and you hereby consent to Simplifyhire taking such actions.</p>
                                    <p>If you have turned on browser push notification and wish to turn them off, you may do so by visiting the settings on your browser.</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message interview reminder from Simplifyhire when an Employer has scheduled interviews with you. In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Simplifyhire consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your phone number and that you have the right to accept text messages at the number. Simplifyhire will only send you a text message reminder for such interview and you agree to accept such text message reminder on your cell phone, including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system. You acknowledge that if the words “automated,” “automatic,” or similar words are used on the Site in connection with calls or text messages, these words do not refer to the generation or storage of a phone number. Simplifyhire only calls the number that you generated and stored when you provided your number to Simplifyhire. In the event you change your phone number, you agree to promptly update your Simplifyhire account with the new number. Please note that since these text message services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those providers. We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive such text messages.</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may also insert functionality into messages relating to your application allowing you to place calls directly to third parties. Please note this functionality is provided solely as a courtesy and that such calls are not placed through or tracked by Simplifyhire. Your standard calling rates with your phone provider will apply.</p>
                                    <p>You may receive messages, including but not limited to, emails or email notifications corresponding with your or an Employer’s (in the event you applied for a job) activity on or use of the Site, Simplifyhire Apply, Simplifyhire Chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site. In all cases, such messages or notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them. For example, if you accept an interview request, it is your responsibility to follow up with the employer separately to ensure they know your response, do not rely on notifications through Simplifyhire. Simplifyhire disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent. In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Employer. Once an Employer has your contact info, you agree that Simplifyhire is not responsible or liable for the manner in which the Employer uses the info. Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you’re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias. If you send or receive communication on or through the Site, you agree to your communication being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Simplifyhire policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Simplifyhire product or service.</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may enable chatbots, which allows you to take certain actions on the Site, such as apply to a job, update your resume, schedule an interview, or otherwise interact with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (“Chatbot”). You understand that the Chatbot is an automated service that does not involve human interaction. It is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information submitted through the Chatbot. Simplifyhire is not responsible for any loss, damage or inconvenience arising as a consequence of the use (or inability to use) the Chatbot or from the information you submit via the Chatbot.</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire reserves the right to turn on or enable Simplifyhire Chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify you that Simplifyhire Chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer. For Simplifyhire Chat, you may access or view your messages by visiting your Simplifyhire Chat messages dashboard. Simplifyhire may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Simplifyhire Chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice. Please note that if you are using Simplifyhire Chat to communicate with an Employer, Simplifyhire will deliver your messages as instructed by the Employer.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">5. Virtual Communications</h6>
                                    <p>Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in virtual and remote communications using Simplifyhire products, including but not limited to, Simplifyhire Interview, Simplifyhire Hiring Platform, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (“Virtual Interviews”). You understand that Simplifyhire is not a telecommunications service provider and that Simplifyhire is only providing the option for you to communicate with Employers via services that may be offered by third-party providers. Please note that since these telecommunication services may depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays or malfunctions on the part of those providers. We cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive, transmit, or support such phone or video communications. Simplifyhire does not guarantee any aspect of your Virtual Interview experience including transmission of phone or video communications, quality of audio/visual content, data security, or data usage and restrictions. <strong>Simplifyhire is not liable for any claims arising out of your use of Virtual Interviews and you release Simplifyhire from any such claims.</strong> You understand that Simplifyhire does not guarantee the Employer’s schedule or availability for conducting Virtual Interviews and cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us. You also understand that the Employer is responsible for any and all questions, comments, or hiring decisions made. Further, Employers are responsible for any accommodations you need during Virtual Interviews.</p>
                                    <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE OR DATA THAT YOU TRANSMIT WHILE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT, INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, OR YOUR IMAGE OR LIKENESS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SIMPLIFYHIRE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OR PROTECTING ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT DURING YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS. SIMPLIFYHIRE ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR THE MISUSE OF ANY DATA YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT THROUGH USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.</p>
                                    <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT SIMPLIFYHIRE DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">6. Salary, Career, Hiring and Other Information Provided by Simplifyhire</h6>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only. For example, Simplifyhire may provide you with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, number of applies to a Job Listing, responses to certain screener questions for a Job Listing, or the likelihood that a particular event will occur such as being selected for an interview. This information provided by Simplifyhire is based on estimates given for informational purposes only and without warranty, and is subject to change or varying levels of accuracy. These figures are given to Simplifyhire users for the purpose of generalized comparison only. Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.</p>
                                    <p>You understand that Simplifyhire may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">8. Your Job Seeker Data</h6>
                                    <p>As a Job Seeker, you take a variety of actions on our Site and you provide various information. For example, you search for jobs, and Simplifyhire knows and stores the titles of jobs you search for and click on, where those jobs are located, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (if indicated on the Job Listings), the Job Listings you apply to, your amount of activity or time of most recent activity on Simplifyhire, information you provide directly to Simplifyhire including desired salary, or past experience, or any information in your Simplifyhire Profile, or any of your other behavior on the Site or information provided. You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who provided the information or undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity.

                                    <p>When you create an Simplifyhire account, a Company Page or post employment opportunities and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites on the Site, whether as part of the Simplifyhire Career Connector or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement, the terms associated with any Simplifyhire service you are using, and all of Simplifyhire’s policies, including the Simplifyhire Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you.</p>
                                    <p>As an Employer, your account is for business use and not for personal use. Simplifyhire is not responsible for and disclaims all liability if your email is used improperly or falsely by a third party. By registering for an Simplifyhire account, you agree to receive mandatory email updates regarding anomalous activity to your Simplifyhire account. If you attempt to send an email from a name or email address that is not true, accurate, current or complete, we reserve the right to drop such email, and attempting to send such email is a violation of our terms.</p>
                                    <p>In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (“a Linked Account”). A Linked Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (“Admin(s)”) of an Employer account invites other users to the same account. Admin(s) can provide these other users varying levels of access and functionality (“Roles”) within the account, as described on the site, including but not limited to accessing account data or purchasing services from Simplifyhire under such account. If you are an Admin adding a user to a Role or several Roles, you represent to Simplifyhire that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have the authority to allow this data and access to be shared. You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Simplifyhire from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs) that result from the sharing of this data, access to your account, and any purchases made under your account.

Simplifyhire makes no warranty regarding, and disclaims any liability for, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or reliability of such notices.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">2. Employer Services Including Simplifyhire Job Apply and Screener Questions</h6>
                                    <p>You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Simplifyhire may activate its Simplifyhire Apply relay function for use in connection with your Job Listings, and that any Job Seekers who wish to indicate an interest in such Job Listing may only do so through Simplifyhire Apply. You also agree that Simplifyhire may activate a chat bot, which enables Job Seekers to apply to your Job Post by answering questions. The answers a Job Seeker submits are presented to you as a job application. When you use Simplifyhire applicant management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Simplifyhire Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Simplifyhire may make available functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a application. You agree that by using such applicant management tools, you are instructing Simplifyhire to assemble the job seeker’s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Simplifyhire into one document. You further agree that Simplifyhire is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements. By using these tools, you are providing information to Simplifyhire and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker. For example, when you choose whether a qualification is preferred or required (including marking it as a deal breaker), this information may be highlighted to Job Seekers. Additionally, you consent to any information shared through Simplifyhire being processed and analyzed by Simplifyhire according to this Agreement and Simplifyhire’s Privacy Policy. Simplifyhire may store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.</p>
                                    <p>You are responsible for the contents of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, Company Pages that you create, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Simplifyhire Job Apply or otherwise, and agree that Simplifyhire is not responsible for such content and disclaims all liability for such content, including as to whether such content is legal. You agree that Simplifyhire may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Company Page, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason. Simplifyhire further does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. You are solely responsible for checking your Employer dashboard to view job applications and other information. Any notifications, such as emails, you may receive about applications or other activities, are provided solely as a courtesy to you and you should not rely on them.</p>
                                    <p>In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable. If you do not feel comfortable sending a message, including but not limited to an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Simplifyhire’s relay functions, do not use the Simplifyhire relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via the personal information provided in such Job Seeker’s resume or application or by whatever method you so choose. When using the Simplifyhire Apply function, Simplifyhire will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Simplifyhire by you, however, Simplifyhire has no ability to verify the contact information provided by you. In the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Simplifyhire for any damages resulting therefrom.</p>
                                    <p>When you use the Simplifyhire Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Simplifyhire may add functions into the corresponding Simplifyhire Apply emails. For example, Simplifyhire may mask or hide contact information, such as email addresses, from resumes or applications and may substitute it with an alias. In addition, Simplifyhire may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview. Simplifyhire may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume. When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Simplifyhire to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction. If you choose such option, you agree you are instructing us to send out rejection notices to such job seekers and set them to rejected in your job seeker dashboard. You further acknowledge that Simplifyhire has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately. When you use Simplifyhire’s applicant management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to job seekers whose status you set to “rejected”. If you choose such option, you acknowledge that Simplifyhire has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices.</p>
                                    <p>You agree that Simplifyhire may take action to try to identify and reduce spam applications, and that one method of doing so may include imposing a cover letter requirement for such applicants. Simplifyhire does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Simplifyhire know a Job Seeker’s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker’s qualifications or interest in your job listing. You agree that Simplifyhire Apply and Simplifyhire’s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Simplifyhire assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.</p>
                                    <p>You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Simplifyhire, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Company Page created or claimed by you, or any Job Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Job Seekers contained in any of the foregoing). Simplifyhire may make Job Post analytics data available on a Company Page or elsewhere on the Site, and may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Simplifyhire’s discretion. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Simplifyhire product, Simplifyhire reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Simplifyhire product as well as any other Simplifyhire product, including but not limited to those Simplifyhire products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance. Simplifyhire may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per contemporaneous US Federal Reserve interest rates plus 10% or the maximum interest permitted by law, whichever is lower and (ii) a statutory lump-sum indemnity for recovery cost, if provided for under applicable laws, and (iii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Simplifyhire incurs collecting such late payments.</p>
                                    <p>When you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, and messages) through or using the Site, Simplifyhire may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Simplifyhire product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise. When you view, send, store or receive materials through or using the Site or when you simply use or visit the Site, Simplifyhire may inform a Job Seeker that you have taken an action, for example, with regards to a Job Post, Job Seeker’s Resume, or application such as pausing or closing a Job Post, opening the Resume or application, viewing the Resume or application, responding to the Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to the application or Job Post, and you hereby consent to Simplifyhire taking such actions.</p>

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE ANY API AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT SIMPLIFYHIRE DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF ANY SIMPLIFYHIRE API. <strong>It is your responsibility to regularly review any Simplifyhire Site for the most up-to-date information (including, but not limited to, explanations about how features work, disclaimers and disclosures regarding the services provided, method for charging) about Simplifyhire’s products and services. By using an API, rather than directly using the Site or an Simplifyhire App, you agree to all information provided on the Site or an Simplifyhire App. Use of an Application or ATS via an API, rather than direct use of the Site or an Simplifyhire App, shall not excuse any lack of information or understanding about Simplifyhire’s products and services where that information is otherwise provided on the Site or an Simplifyhire App.</strong></p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">3. Job Match</h6>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may use Job Seekers’ application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of their activity on Simplifyhire to determine whether the words of their resume and answers to screener questions match the words of your Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa. You further agree and consent that Simplifyhire may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to you as matches or not matches. Simplifyhire may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Simplifyhire product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">4. Salary, Applies or Other Information Provided by Simplifyhire</h6>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only. For example, Simplifyhire may provide Job Seekers with data regarding number of applies to a Job Listing, responses to certain screener questions for a Job listing. All such figures provided by Simplifyhire are estimates given for informational purposes only, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy. Simplifyhire may also provide data regarding impressions in relation to your job post. Such figures are provided for informational purposes only, are subject to change at any time, and Simplifyhire does not guarantee their accuracy. Simplifyhire reserves the right to change the method of measuring such figures at any time.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">5. Screening Tools</h6>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may make available to you screening tools for your use during the application process, including screener questions. Simplifyhire is licensing these tools to you for your use as you determine. By using any screening product, made available to you by Simplifyhire, you agree that you have made the determination to use these tools as part of your application process, and the substantive questions you ask or choose are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Simplifyhire. You are the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a job seeker. You are solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact”. <strong>You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law. While Simplifyhire is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Simplifyhire does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.</strong> You agree to indemnify Simplifyhire for any and all claims arising out of your use of a Screening Tool, including any claims that any screening tool does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar or equivalent law, or that such Screening Tool results in a “disparate impact”.</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may offer Employers the ability to activate a automation feature on their account. Activating this means the Employer is instructing Simplifyhire to send a message on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application. To prevent a rejection notice from being sent, you must indicate your interest in the application on Simplifyhire. Any interactions you have directly with a Job Seeker and not through a tool provided by Simplifyhire (for example, emailing a Job Seeker directly instead of through an Simplifyhire Relay Service) are not visible to Simplifyhire, and will not prevent an Employer Automated rejection notice from being sent. If you activate Employer Automation then you must interact with a Job Seeker through a tool provided by Simplifyhire to prevent an Employer Automated rejection notice from being sent. If you activate Employer Assist you agree that you are instructing Simplifyhire to send these messages to job seekers with whom you do not interact within your chosen time frame, and you agree to indemnify Simplifyhire from any claims arising therefrom. You further agree that Simplifyhire may notify Job Seekers about the estimated time frame during which they may expect to hear back from you based on the time frame you choose in Employer Automation.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">6. Communication through Simplifyhire</h6>
                                    <p>You may receive messages, emails or email notifications corresponding with your or a Job Seeker’s activity on or use of the Site, Simplifyhire Job Apply, Simplifyhire Chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site. In all cases, such messages or notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them. For example, if you wish to interview a Job Seeker, it is your responsibility to follow up with the Job Seeker separately to ensure they know about the interview, do not rely on notifications through Simplifyhire. Simplifyhire disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent. In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.</p>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Job Seeker. Once a Job Seeker has your contact info, you agree that Simplifyhire is not responsible or liable for the manner in which the Employer uses the info. Should you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you’re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias. If you send or receive communication on or through the Site, you agree to your communication being processed, analyzed, reviewed, and stored, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites’ rules and other Simplifyhire policies, content moderation, and to improve the Site or any other Simplifyhire product or service.</p>
                                    <p>Specifically, if you post a Job Listing directly on Simplifyhire, applications are sent only to your Simplifyhire dashboard; any other notifications you may receive are provided solely as a courtesy to you. For example, you may not receive application email notifications if a Job Seeker has not answered screener questions correctly, although these applications will be sent to your Simplifyhire dashboard. Simplifyhire reserves the right to turn on or enable Simplifyhire Chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify Job Seekers that Simplifyhire Chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer. For Simplifyhire Chat, you may access or view your messages by visiting your Simplifyhire Chat messages dashboard. Simplifyhire may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Simplifyhire Chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">7. Virtual Communications</h6>
                                    <p>You understand that Simplifyhire is only providing the option for you to communicate with Job Seekers via services that may be offered by third-party providers.</p>
                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">8. Job Seeker Import</h6>
                                    <p>Simplifyhire may offer a platform that allows you, or someone acting on your behalf or authority (such as a recruitment management service) to upload information about job applicants to Simplifyhire and to interact with these individuals and direct Simplifyhire to interact with these individuals on your behalf (hereafter “Job Seeker Import”).

By using Job Seeker Import, You represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary rights and permissions from, and provided all necessary information and disclosures to, job applicants as required under applicable data protection law for You to provide or otherwise make available Client Personal Data to Simplifyhire using Job Seeker Import, and, without limiting the foregoing, (a) no individual whose Personal Data you provide or otherwise make available to Simplifyhire using Job Seeker Import has exercised any right or made any request to You that would prevent or otherwise limit your ability to share such individual’s Personal Data with Simplifyhire for processing in connection with this Agreement and (b) all job applicants have consented that their data will be shared with Simplifyhire (in accordance with Simplifyhire’s Terms and Privacy Policy) and that Simplifyhire may contact them over email as part of your hiring process, including requesting them to create an account with Simplifyhire. You agree to defend and indemnify Simplifyhire for any breach of the foregoing sentence.</p>

You acknowledge that SimplifyHire is not responsible or liable for any such third parties or for the availability of, or the materials located on or through any External Sites. You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for the applicable External Site if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on an External Site.</p>
                                    <p>In addition, SimplifyHire may provide you with links to third party sites that offer you services for your use or benefit. We may stop offering any such third party sites or services at any time. If you choose to use such third party sites or services, you enter into an agreement with such third party alone at your own risk. When entering into an agreement with such parties, you are giving them your data directly and your rights and their obligations are determined by their privacy policies and terms of service. We are not responsible for any content or services provided by these third parties, and disclaim all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize such third parties. We are additionally not responsible for any payment that may be asked of you by such third party. You will be notified on the site that these are third party sites and services, and not SimplifyHire.</p>
                                    <p>For example, SimplifyHire may provide you with access to a link on SimplifyHire to background check services offered and performed by a third party (each a “Third-Party Background Check Service”). This service may be offered in the form of permitting a Jobseeker to request their own background check or permitting an Employer to request a background check of a Jobseeker.

                                    <h6 className="font-weight-bold">3. User Content</h6>
                                    <p>Some parts of the Site, such as message boards and forums or job posting pages, may allow users to post content like Job Listings, resumes, information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials (any such materials that a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on or through the Site, or any materials that a user submits to SimplifyHire, including where it is stated that such materials may be posted on the Site or a third party website, including, but not limited to, mobile apps, are referred to herein as “User Content”). Such functionality is designed to help users obtain career and company information, to let users know of jobs, to provide information about potential job candidates, and facilitate other communication. User Content is provided by third-party contributors, many of whom may use anonymous screen names. User Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or deceptive. Once updated by the user, it may take a few days for the change to User Content to be reflected.  SimplifyHire does not endorse and is not responsible for any User Content, including any opinion, advice, information, or statement contained therein. Some elements of SimplifyHire job search results pages may appear to be content produced by SimplifyHire, but are actually a reproduction of user-generated search queries. Job Posts or other User Content may be reformatted or include words such as “Powered by SimplifyHire”. Such content retains its status as User Content despite reformatting or addition of “Powered by SimplifyHire” or a similar phrase. You acknowledge that by accessing the Site, you may come into contact with content (including User Content) that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and you acknowledge that SimplifyHire shall have no liability with respect to such content.</p>
                                    <p>You must not post any User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content. You must also not post any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes spamming or flooding.</p>
                                    <p>You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether your own or of another person), such as social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier. Posting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences. SimplifyHire may remove any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting of such identification information. SimplifyHire reserves the right to change the display of resume on its Site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields, rearranging its format, and changing visual elements.</p>
                                    <p>Although SimplifyHire has no obligation to do so, SimplifyHire may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in SimplifyHire’s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), or that SimplifyHire deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate. SimplifyHire may limit your use of the Site, including but not limited to, your ability to contact other Employers or Job Seekers. If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please <a href="https://careerconnector.simplifyhire.com/contact-us">contact</a> SimplifyHire immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal. You acknowledge and agree that SimplifyHire does not have any obligation to host or remove any User Content, and i) the interpretation of whether any User Content violates any SimplifyHire policy, ii) whether to publish or to withdraw from publication any User Content, and iii) whether to exclude any material that any party seeks to post on SimplifyHire, will always remain within the sole discretion of SimplifyHire. You agree that SimplifyHire has no liability to you or anyone else arising from its editorial decisions. You acknowledge and agree that SimplifyHire is an interactive computer service and does not have any obligation to screen any User Content, or to include any User Content (including without limitation Job Postings) in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any User Content from publication for any or no reason.</p>
                                    <p>SimplifyHire reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site; to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. This means, for example, that SimplifyHire may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information. When you post on SimplifyHire confidentially or otherwise (e.g. anonymous Company Reviews or a confidential Job Posting), your identity may be discoverable by legal request, including, but not limited to, requests from the government or law enforcement.</p>
                                    <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, SimplifyHire reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers. Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Posting specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability. Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Posting implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Posting that directly or indirectly discriminate against Job Seekers or otherwise violate applicable law.</p>

The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC. § 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow SimplifyHire to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
